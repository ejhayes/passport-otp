# Passport-OTP

This is a fork of the [Passport-TOTP](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-totp) library and uses `otplib` instead of `notp`.

[Passport](http://passportjs.org/) strategy for two-factor authentication using
a [TOTP](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238) value.

This module lets you authenticate using a TOTP value in your Node.js
applications.  By plugging into Passport, TOTP two-factor authentication can be
easily and unobtrusively integrated into any application or framework that
supports [Connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/)-style middleware,
including [Express](http://expressjs.com/).  TOTP values can be generated by
hardware devices or software applications, including [Google Authenticator](https://code.google.com/p/google-authenticator/)
and [Authy](https://authy.com/).

Note that in contrast to most Passport strategies, TOTP authentication requires
that a user already be authenticated using an initial factor.  Requirements
regarding when to require a second factor are a matter of application-level
policy, and outside the scope of both Passport and this strategy.

## Install

    $ npm install passport-otp-strategy

## Usage

#### Configure Strategy

The TOTP authentication strategy authenticates a user using a TOTP value
generated by a hardware device or software application (known as a token).  The
strategy requires a `setup` callback.

The `setup` callback accepts a previously authenticated `user` and calls `done`
providing a `key` used to verify the token value.  Authentication
fails if the value is not verified.

    passport.use(new OtpStrategy(
      {
        codeField: 'code',
        authenticator: {}
      }
      function(user, done) {
        TotpKey.findOne({ userId: user.id }, function (err, key) {
          if (err) { return done(err); }
          return done(null, key.key);
        });
      }
    ));

You can find a full listing of `authenticator` options [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/otplib#available-options). Note that the `crypto` library will be used by default. If you want to change that, you can specify it in `authenticator.crypto` (more on that [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/otplib#using-specific-otp-implementations)).

#### Authenticate Requests

Use `passport.authenticate()`, specifying the `'otp'` strategy, to authenticate
requests.

For example, as route middleware in an [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
application:

    app.post('/verify-otp', 
      passport.authenticate('otp', { failureRedirect: '/verify-otp' }),
      function(req, res) {
        req.session.authFactors = [ 'otp' ];
        res.redirect('/');
      });

## Examples

For a complete, working example, refer to the [two-factor example](https://github.com/ejhayes/passport-otp/tree/master/examples/two-factor). Please keep in mind that this example is not production ready as-is.

## Tests

    $ npm install
    $ make test
